# 3-WaySequenceAlignment
This repository contains the Python implementation for 3-way sequence alignment using both recursive and dynamic programming approaches. Familiarity with pairwise sequence alignment helps trace through the code, since the code is a mere generalization of pairwise sequence alignment.
Note: The approach here is a simplified version of sequence alignment with some assumptions about base cases. A more comprehensive solution should handle the base cases more properly. Details about these basic assumptions will be made available at a later date.
